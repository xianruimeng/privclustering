    @brief Class represents simple clustering algorithm based on self-organized feature map. 
    @details This algorithm uses amount of clusters that should be allocated as a size of SOM map. Captured objects by neurons are clusters.
             Algorithm is able to process data with Gaussian distribution that has spherical forms.
    
    Example:
    @code
        # load list of points for cluster analysis
        sample = read_sample(path);
        
        # create instance of SOM-SC algorithm to allocated two clusters
