    @brief Class represents clustering algorithm K-Medoids (another one title is PAM - Parti).
    @details The algorithm is less sensitive to outliers tham K-Means. The principle difference between K-Medoids and K-Medians is that
             K-Medoids uses existed points from input data space as medoids, but median in K-Medians can be unreal object (not from
             input data space).
    
    Example:
    @code
        # load list of points for cluster analysis
        sample = read_sample(path);
        
        # create instance of K-Medoids algorithm

        # run cluster analysis and obtain results
